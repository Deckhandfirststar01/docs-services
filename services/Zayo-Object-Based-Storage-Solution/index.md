# Getting started with <service_short_name>
{: #gettingstarted}

<service_name> is a web-scale unstructured data storage service, designed for high durability, resiliency and security. You can store and access your data from anywhere and since the service is supported by the global Zayo network, you can move your data in and out of storage with no egress or operational charges. Developers can leverage <service_name> with their applications, with other hyperscale public cloud services, or integrate with other IBM速 Bluemix速 services including analytics, compute and cognitive services.

Before an application developer can begin to work with the <service_name>, services must be stood up within Zayo using the Tranzact portal.

To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Zayo Tranzact website located at https://tranzact.zayo.com/#!/get-pricing/cloud/chooseSolution
2. Select the Object-Based Storage tile.
3. If you are an existing Zayo customer, select the location(s) from which you would like to access the service.
4. Create your bucket names and requested sizes.
5. Select your connectivity method, note that removal of egress charges only applies to private circuits.
6. Finalize your quote request with a Zayo service expert.
7. Upon service initialization, you will be provided with access instructions and keys.
8. Complete your Watson integration on the IBM速 Bluemix速 portal by plugging in your API credentials.
