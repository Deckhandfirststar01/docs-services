 Getting started with GeoSuite APIs
{:gettingstarted} 

The Location Studio GeoSutie APIs provide a full suite of GeoServices. From simply displaying the position of a person, place or thing on a map, searching for something or someplace, and then finding the best way to get there. The search APIs provide a powerful single box search implementation for looking up Brands, Categories of POIs and even offer the user suggestions based on the characters theyâ€™ve typed into the search box for possible search queries.
