<!-- This template is for getting started with a Bluemix service. It is a task template intended to document productive use of the service. It is not intended for discovery and conceptual information.  -->

<!-- The name of this file should remain index.md.
Please delete out content examples and coding that you are not using for your service. -->

# Getting started with LEMTradeIt
{: #gettingstarted}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->

LEMTradeIt is a financial ecosystem that enables our partners – developers, publishers, social networks – to easily add portfolio tracking and trading of equities, ETFs, options, FX and digital currencies with most online US brokers in minutes. Let your users link their brokerage accounts easily and securely on a web or mobile platform.

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->
We provide a [mobile guide](https://www.trade.it/quickstart#ios-guide#example-app) and [web guide](https://www.trade.it/quickstart#web-guide#gettingStarted) to help you get up-and-running as easily as possible.
Check out our [API documentation.](https://www.trade.it/api)
To get started with TradeIt, you must first request a TradeIt API Key [here!](https://developers.trade.it/register/register)

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

Before an application developer can... the administrator must ...

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

Once you've obtained a TradeIt key, follow the steps below to go live.

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples: 
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.
