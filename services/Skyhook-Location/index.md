# Getting started with Skyhook Precision Location
{: #gettingstarted_SkyhookLocation}

## Overview

The Skyhook Precision Location API provides access to positioning information derived from the analysis of positioning anchors including Wi-Fi access points, cell IDs and others in known locations. The client applications make XML-over-HTTPS calls to the API while providing a listing of observed positioning anchors within range of the client device, along with GPS information if available. The Location Server API returns a calculated geographic location based on those inputs, and optionally a street address and time zone.

In addition to the derived location the API returns location based on the client's IP address. While this information is not a reliable source for navigation, it can be used to provide context in the event that more accurate methods are not available, it may be used as the best estimate of location.{:shortdesc}
