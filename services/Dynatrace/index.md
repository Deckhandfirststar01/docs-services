<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.
