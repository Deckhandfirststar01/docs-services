# Getting started with Phunware SDKs for Marketing Automation and Mapping
{: #gettingstarted}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED -->

With Phunware's Marketing Automation SDK you can send marketing campaigns that are displayed as notifications to the mobile devices of your app users. User tap on the notification to open the app or deep link to a promotion or other app page. Phunware's SDK powers global and targeted broadcast campaigns, as well as entry and exit campaigns triggered by location geofences or beacons (BLE or vBLE).

With Phunware's Mapping SDK you can host maps of your campuses and buildings and populate the maps with points of interest to power static wayfinding. In addition Phunware supports hardware agnostic Location Provider integrations using hyperlocation (wifi), BLE, or vBLE signals to offer dynamic (blue dot) wayfinding in your apps.

As a Phunware SDK user, you will be provided with access to the MaaS portal, Phunware's web-based configuration portal where you will configure Attributes-Profiles, Geofences, and Beacons for Marketing Automation and manage the campaigns that keep users engaged in your app. For wayfinding you will use the MaaS portal to configure maps, including POIs and routes and to integrate location providers for dynamic blue dot wayfinding experiences in your app.

4. Step 4: Create you apps in MaaS portal to obtain integration keys.
5. Step 5: Complete integration steps
6. Step 6: Apply desired use cases to your code base and configure
7. Step 7: Complete the configuration of these app features in MaaS portal (Configuration guides and training videos for MaaS portal are available at developer.phunware.com.)

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->


<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->






<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples: 
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.
