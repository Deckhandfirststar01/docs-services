<!-- This template is for getting started with a Bluemix service. It is a task template intended to document productive use of the service. It is not intended for discovery and conceptual information.  -->

# Getting started with Natural Language Generation APIs
{: #gettingstarted_nlgapi}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->


With Arria’s Natural Language Generation APIs, you can quickly and easily integrate NLG into your application to add context-aware, instantly updatable, domain-relevant narrative explanation of any data. Arria NLG’s patented AI technologies provide real-time advanced data analysis and commentary.

## Narrative APIs
**_Embed ready-made cutting-edge NLG content_**

With Arria’s narrative services, you get a pre-written report for a particular domain. The narrative service takes in data, works out what matters and returns a narrative that is ready to go – onto your website, into your dashboard, wherever. For example, use our profit and loss service [coming soon], and it will work out which aspects of your business are doing well and which areas are experiencing losses. A market stress-testing narrative service can tell you how news of world events could impact your stock portfolio. Narrative services give you an instantly updateable report, in seconds.

## Microservices [_coming soon_]
**_Add the most frequently used small-scale linguistic features to your existing systems_**

Microservices are NLG functions that you can use to make the reports you generate sound like they were written by human experts. Microservices handle the low-level detail of English so you don’t have to. For example, use the aOrAn microservice to make your system choose the correct article – either “a” or “an” based on what the following word sounds like. Or, use the pluralNoun microservice to turn “profit” to “profits” or “child” to “children”. Microservices make writing NLG systems easy.

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

## Before you begin
To use Arria’s APIs, it is important that you understand the basics of RESTful web services and JSON representations. Through IBM Cloud, you bind Arria’s Natural Language Generation APIs service to your application in the same way that you would add any service available on IBM Cloud.
You need cURL, or another data transfer tool, installed before you can use the service.

**Note:** Arria's NLG APIs are best viewed using the latest version of your web browser. Please use the most up-to-date version of Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari.

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

## About Arria NLG
Arria’s Natural Language Generation (NLG) solutions enjoy a substantial competitive edge in the marketplace for a few important reasons. Arria NLG technology extracts key insights directly from underlying data to create unique data-driven narratives every time. Other NLG systems are also data-driven but limited by predetermined “ﬁll in the blanks” templated narratives. 
Arria NLG technology captures industry expertise and the interpretation strategy of the expert. Other NLG systems simply automate the generation of predictive text. 
Arria NLG technology is based on over 30 years of data science and computational linguistic expertise. Other NLG systems are fairly new and may bump into Arria’s patents as they progress.

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples: 
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.
