# Getting started with Moni.ai
{: #gettingstarted}

Moni.ai allows you to define new ways to interact with your business by defining Voice Channels. A Voice Channel starts with a trigger pattern that Moni.ai listens to. After a user said that trigger pattern you define what happens visually using Node-Red. Doing that you have full control over the process and you can query databases, retrieve relevant information or call APIs and perform tasks.
After defining a Voice Channel you can talk to Moni.ai using the iOS or Android app, connected service, the api or using the Moni.ai website.

To design a Voice Channel, complete these steps: 

1. Subscribe to one of the Moni.ai plans on Bluemix

  First things first you need a valid subscription to Moni.ai. If you are evaluating Moni.ai you can start with the free developers edition. Otherwise editions differ between the number of Voice Channels you are allowed to publish and the amount of interactions/api calls that are included per month. After the selected plan has been subscribed you can press the "open Moni.ai Dashboard" button to connect your plan with an existing Moni.ai user - respectively sign up for a new user.

2. Deploy the Moni.ai Voice Channel designer to Bluemix.

  The Voice Channel designer is based on Node-Red having three Moni.ai nodes preinstalled. You can deploy the environment easily following the "[Moni.ai Voice Channel designer](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://git.ng.bluemix.net/moniai/voice-channel-design){:new_window}" link.

3. Create your Voice Channel using the Node-Red Moni.ai nodes.

  For information and examples on how to create your first Voice Channel read the [Moni.ai Setup Guide](https://moni.ai/documents/moniai_setup_guide.pdf){:new_window} tutorial. After you designed your Voice Channel on Node-Red the trigger pattern will appear on the [Moni.ai Dashboard](https://moni.ai/developers). You are then able to trigger it by saying the trigger pattern.
