<!-- This template is for getting started with a Bluemix service. It is a task template intended to document productive use of the service. It is not intended for discovery and conceptual information.  -->

<!-- The name of this file should remain index.md.
Please delete out content examples and coding that you are not using for your service. -->

# Getting started with InfluxCloud
{: #gettingstarted_InfluxCloud}

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->

InfluxCloud is a... -OR-
With InfluxCloud, you can...  -OR-
Use InfluxCloud to...
{:shortdesc}

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

Before an application developer can embed single sign-on capability into an app, the administrator must create unbound service instances by using the Bluemix user interface.

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

To integrate your app with the service, complete these steps: -OR-
To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps: -OR-
Complete these steps to get started with the BigInsights service:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples: 
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.

1. Step 1 to integrate app with the service.
2. Step 2 to integrate app with the service.

	```
	Copyable example for this step. 
	This example might be multiline code
	to copy into a file. 
	When displayed in the doc framework, 
	it will have a copy button on the right.
	The user can click to copy the example 
	so they can paste it into their code editor.
	```
	{: codeblock}

3. Step 3. In this step, we have a single line command example. When displayed by the doc framework, it will have a $ shown at the beginning of the line, and a copy button on the right. The copy button will copy the command but not the $.

	```
	my command -and -options
	```
	{: pre}

4. Step 4
	```
	This is a bunch of output from
		a command or program I ran
			and it can run lots of lines
			and the doc framework will show it as 
			output with no copy button.
	```
	{: screen}
